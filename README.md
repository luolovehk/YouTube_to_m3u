## ðŸ“¡ From Global Playlist to Personalized Streaming â€” Introducing 
[M3USe](https://m3use.projectmoose.xyz)

Hey folks â€” if you've used or followed this repo in the past, you might remember it started as an automated GitHub Actions workflow that created a public M3U playlist of livestreams (mostly YouTube). You could request channels, and I'd manually add them to the playlist for everyone.

But things have evolved.

### ðŸŽ‰ Meet [M3USe](https://m3use.projectmoose.xyz) â€” A Web App for Custom Livestream Playlists

âœ… Add livestreams from **YouTube**, **Twitch**, and **Dailymotion**  
âœ… Build your **own playlist** â€” no more global list  
âœ… Use with **any IPTV player** (VLC, Kodi, TiviMate, etc.)  
âœ… Your playlist, your links, your rules

ðŸ’¡ No more waiting for manual updates or one-size-fits-all playlists. You just paste the channel URL, and the backend takes care of the rest.
